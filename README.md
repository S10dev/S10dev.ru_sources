# Social web blog

This is the social web blog for everyone. You can post your images and messages here. Write comments under the posts, subscribe to autor and etc.

## Getting Started

First of all you're need to fill ./yatube/yatube/.env file. Pick the Django secret-key. Then write postgres name, user and password (by default it filled some default parameters). After those steps you can start docker-compose file and the project will be started automatically

If you need to install my fixtures, just run load_fixtures.sh script while you have your docker-compose up (by the way after installing fixtures you can login as s10;123 as administrator)
